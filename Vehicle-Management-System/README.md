# Vehicle Management System

This project demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism in Java using a vehicle model.

Concepts covered:
- Abstract base class (Vehicle)
- Method overriding
- Subclass-specific behaviors
- Polymorphism using base class references
- Type casting to access subclass methods

Classes included:
- Vehicle (abstract class)
- Truck
- Motorbike

The system stores different vehicle types in a Vehicle array and demonstrates dynamic method dispatch and casting.
