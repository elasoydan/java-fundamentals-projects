# Employee Management System

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

Concepts covered:
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic binding
- Use of base class references (Employee[] array)

Classes included:
- Employee (base class)
- Manager
- RandDEngineer
- ProductionManagerAssistant

The system demonstrates polymorphism by storing different subclasses in an Employee array and invoking overridden methods.
