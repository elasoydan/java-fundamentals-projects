# Employee System (Abstract Class)

This project demonstrates abstraction and inheritance in Java.

Concepts covered:
- Abstract base class (Employee)
- Method overriding
- Salary calculation for different employee types
- Polymorphism
- Interface implementation (IPayment)
- Tax calculation logic

Classes included:

The system calculates salaries differently based on employee type and applies tax deductions using defined rules.
